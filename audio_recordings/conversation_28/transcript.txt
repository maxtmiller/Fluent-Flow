System: Sure! Let's start the conversation about snow. Have you ever seen snow before?

User: Hello?

System: Hello! Have you ever experienced snowfall in your life?

Feedback:

- User: "Hello?"

Feedback: The user's sentence is a simple greeting, but it lacks context or relevance to the previous system message. It would have been better if the user had provided a more specific response, such as answering the system's question about experiencing snowfall.
