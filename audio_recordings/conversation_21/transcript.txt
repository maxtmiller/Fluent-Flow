System: Sure, let's start. What are your thoughts on the current state of the economy?

- "I believe that the economy is not doing very well due to the high inflation and increase in many prices." 

This sentence is grammatically correct and effectively expresses the user's opinion about the state of the economy. However, it would be more concise to say "I believe the economy is suffering due to high inflation and rising prices."

- "Well, I know that many products in the store are much more expensive than before, as I've kept record of this, and I know of high inflation because there are increased mortgage rates and lower interest rates."

This sentence is a bit long and lacks clarity in its construction. Here is a revised version: "I have noticed that prices of many products in stores have increased significantly. I believe this is due to high inflation, which is evidenced by increased mortgage rates and lower interest rates."

- "Yes, it's been harder to live and I had to live more discreetly and spend less money."

This sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity and flow: "Yes, it has become more challenging to maintain my standard of living, so I have had to be more frugal and reduce my expenses."

In general, the user effectively communicates their opinions and observations about the state of the economy. However, it would be helpful to provide more specific details or examples to support their claims. Additionally, the user could focus on using more concise and clear language to improve the overall flow and readability of their sentences.
