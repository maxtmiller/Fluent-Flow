System: Sure! Let's talk about geology. What aspect of geology are you most interested in?

I am interested in learning about plate tectonics. Can you explain how plate tectonics work?

User: Sure. Convection currents drive the movement of Earth's rigid tectonic plates in the planet's fluid molten mantle. In places where convection currents rise up towards the crossface, tectonic plates move away from each other in a process known as seafloor spreading.

System: That's a great explanation! How does seafloor spreading contribute to the formation of new crust?

User: Hot magma rises to the crust surface, cracks deep below in this ocean floor, and the magma pushes up and out to form mid-ocean ridges. Mid-ocean ridges are spreading centers or fault lines where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other.

System: Fascinating! What happens when two tectonic plates move away from each other at mid-ocean ridges?

User: You tell me.

System: Well, when two tectonic plates move away from each other at mid-ocean ridges, magma rises up from the mantle and fills the gap between the plates. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms new crust, contributing to the growth of the ocean floor. This process is called seafloor spreading.
