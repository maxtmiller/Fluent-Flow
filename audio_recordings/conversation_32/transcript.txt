Feedback:

- "Everything is so large, mysterious, they haven't even uncovered most of it."

The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity and cohesion. Here are a few suggestions:

1. "Everything in the ocean is so large and mysterious." - This clarifies that the user is referring to things specifically within the ocean.

2. "Much of it remains undiscovered." - This sentence conveys the same meaning but in a more concise and clear manner.

Overall, the user's sentence effectively conveys their fascination with the ocean, but by making these suggested changes, the sentence could be improved in terms of clarity and flow.
